### Project Description
We are creating a schedule planning website that will allow you, as students, to select and backpack the classes that you will potentially take next semester. The selected courses will that you choose to backpack will be displayed in a table on our website. We will also enhance the appearance and the functionality of the website in order to make it user-friendly and navigable.

### Reach Features

#### Reach Feature 1 Allow users to backpack classes (3 pts)
Students will be able to select classes they will potentially take based on the different schools, subjects, catalog numbers and section numbers. Our website will display all of the classes offered at the University of Michigan for the specified term in the form of a table. There will be a “backpack” button by each class for students to click on. Once they click on the backpack button, the detailed information about the specific class will appear on the backpack page. On this page, students will have the option to click on the “remove” button if they choose to remove a class. In order to help students backpack more than one class, a “HOME” button and “Back to Sections” button will be available on the bottom of the backpack page.

#### Reach Feature 2 Improve user interface using CSS(1 pt)
To enhance the usability and appearance of the our website, we utilized CSS and an existing CSS library known as bootstrap. In order to improve the user experience, we decided to format the classes offered as well as the classes backpacked in a table. This table consisted of alternating colors (white - blue) so that it would be easier for students to see and determine which section offered was best for them.  We incorporated CSS for our lists and buttons as well. The background of the listed items are formatted to have the same effects as buttons by adding shadows around it. We also included bootstrap library to format the “Back”, “HOME”, “backpack” and “remove” buttons. We changed the style of the buttons in order to match the theme of each page. 
Additionally, we included a picture at the top of each page to aesthetically improve user experience and motivate students to be excited about their upcoming class schedule. We have a picture from each season in Ann Arbor to represent year-round academics.  Another function we incorporated on our website was the hover effect which applies to the table on the backpack page as well as the table outlining the sections offered. This effect displays the class information in bold when the cursor hovers over all of the text in the row. The hover effect is also used for buttons presented throughout our website. This effect highlights the buttons and makes it easier for users to see the location of the cursor and generates website responsiveness. Additionally, we decided on specific color themes and font sizes in order to improve the appearance and overall cohesiveness of the website.
